            <h2><u>Hi, I'm Patrick Brian Ricafort Carillo</u></h2>
           <p>Hey everyone! I’m an 18-year-old first-year BSIT student at Quezon City University. While I have a passion for technology and the digital world, my true escape lies in nature. When I’m not immersed in code or studying, you can find me exploring the great outdoors—hiking mountains, wandering through lush forests, or enjoying quiet moments by a river. Nature recharges my spirit and inspires my creativity, reminding me to appreciate life’s little wonders.
            In addition to my love for nature, I enjoy diving into online games to connect with friends and explore new worlds. I’m an avid reader, captivated by both fiction and non-fiction, and I love getting lost in films that tell compelling stories. I also take pride in dressing nicely, as it reflects my personality and boosts my confidence.</p>
